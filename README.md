# Dotfiles

This are my dotfiles, I intend to add all of them here but ofcourse they require significant rewrites just so that I don't leak anything and also to ensure that I can use them comfortably with `stow`.

Currently these dotfiles have the following:
1. nvim config
2. zsh config
3. tmux config
4. alacritty config
5. Karabiner mappings
6. Hammerspoon stuff (specific to MacOS)
7. local scripts

My Current Setup:
- Terminal Emulator - Alacritty
- Terminal Multiplexer - Tmux
- Text Editor - Neovim
- Font - CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font (Cascadia Code patched font)

NOTE TO SELF: Make sure to run `make` to check that all the dependencies are indeed installed on the system.
