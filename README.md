# Dotfiles

This are my dotfiles, I intend to add all of them here but ofcourse they require significant rewrites just so that I don't leak anything and also to ensure that I can use them comfortably with `stow`.

Currently these dotfiles have the following:
1. nvim config
2. zsh config
3. local binaries and programs
4. legacy items (I no longer use but might still be useful)
5. Karabiner mappings
6. Hammerspoon stuff (specific to MacOS)
7. Basic tmux config

NOTE TO SELF: Make sure to run `make` to check that all the dependencies are indeed installed on the system.
