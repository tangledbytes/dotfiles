# Dotfiles

This are my dotfiles, I intend to add all of them here but ofcourse they require significant rewrites just so that I don't leak anything and also to ensure that I can use them comfortably with `stow`.

Currently these dotfiles have the following:
1. nvim config
2. zsh config
3. local binaries and programs
4. legacy items (I no longer use but might still be useful)
